# esprl

Explore Ethereum-like blockchain privately with your RPC URL.

- ðŸ”’ No 3rd party services: only private RPC requests
- ðŸ’¹ ETH and token balances, transaction history
- ðŸ’µ On-chain USD price conversion from oracles

## Motivation

> How is this better than [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io)?

Etherscan and other other 3rd party block explorers collect and track user data. They create logs every time someone opens an address. Private explorers allow viewing information without logging.

> How is this better than [Otterscan](https://github.com/otterscan/otterscan)?

Otterscan is also local, but it does not support token balances or transfer history, which makes it very limited in usefulness. ERC20 / ERC721 / ERC1155 tokens & NFTs are one of the most popular features of EVM-like blockchains.

> Can I verify all network requests?

The explorer only makes requests to specified RPC URL. To audit this, check `src/App.vue`,
`handleConnect`. It uses [micro-ftch](https://github.com/paulmillr/micro-ftch) to
ensure no requests are done outside of the URL. You can add custom logging there.

> How are USD prices calculated?

No external services are used: Chainlink EVM contract provides everything needed.

> Are ERC-20 tokens fully supported?

Yes. To view full token transfer history for an account, open tx Details tab.
It can take up to 50 seconds because of limitations of ETH nodes.
Basically, nodes don't build proper indexes, and full blockchain is scanned.

> Which frontend libraries are used?

[micro-eth-signer](https://github.com/paulmillr/micro-eth-signer) and
[micro-ftch](https://github.com/paulmillr/micro-ftch) empower data retrieval.
Vue.js is used as UI framework.

## Setup

To build the app, execute:

```sh
npm install && npm run dev
```

To build for production:

```sh
npm install && npm run build

# Output is now in `dist/`
# Example: serve `dist/` directory using built-in Python module
cd dist && python3 -m http.server --bind 127.0.0.1
```

The output is 5 files in `dist`: 1 html, 1 js, 1 css, 2 woff icons.

## RPC requirements

Esprl currently only supports user-ran Erigon 3 RPC nodes with 32GB ram, 2.5TB SSD, 4-core CPU & 30Mbps connection. It may support Reth soon.

[Download](https://github.com/erigontech/erigon/releases) Erigon binary / source code and start it:

```sh
erigon --datadir=/data/erigon --prune.mode='archive' --torrent.download.rate="100mb" --http --http.api=eth,erigon,web3,net,debug,trace,txpool,ots --ws --http.corsdomain='*'
```

Initial sync will take 8 hours for ETH mainnet on 100Mbps connection (slower ones can still be used). After that RPC will be ready.
By default, RPC runs on port 8545. If computer which runs it is not the same one
where RPC is accessed from, you will need to expose the port. There are two ways to do this:

1. Install NGINX, do `proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8545`. You will probably need domain and SSL certificate. For example, if domain is `ethnode.com`, you will be able to specify its RPC.
2. SSH tunneling: use SSH connection to forward 8545 to your local machine:
   `ssh -L 5678:127.0.0.1:8545 root@192.168.1.50` where 5678 is port on your local machine,
   `root@192.168.1.50` is user + hostname of Erigon3 server.

### Geth, Reth, Infura

Why aren't other RPCs supported? The app uses archive node API / `trace_filter` extensively:

- Erigon 3 works properly with `prune.mode=archive`
- Geth, Nethermind do not have proper archive mode, so they are not supported
- Reth is not supported, because it limits trace_filter to 10k blocks. They indicated
  willingness to fix the issue: see [#4799](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/issues/4799)
- 3rd party nodes (infura / alchemy / quicknode) are not supported: they limit
  trace_filter API massively even if Erigon backend is selected.

### Hardware requirements

An archive node will need 32GB ram, 2.5TB NVME SSD, 4-core CPU and 30Mbps connection.
A similar new PC can be cost ~$500.

Such server can be rented from providers like [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com) for ~$40 per month.
Make sure to [prohibit private IPs in firewall](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/6386/how-to-prevent-being-blacklisted-for-running-an-ethereum-client/13068).

Macs are also supported.
Fully validating non-archive node has much smaller storage requirements (<1TB).
